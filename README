# Arch linux install guide for system with LVM on top of LUKS

This guide describes my linux setup. I use a not-encrypted boot partition and a
second encrypted LUKS partition. The second partition holds a logical volume
(LVM) for the linux system. The advantage is the (relatively) easy setup and
even the filesystem is hidden from non-authorized users. This setup is often
called LVM on top of LUKS.

The guide ends with the setup of the productive user. Then, the standard
Arch linux beginner's guides should be useful.

There are two guides which do basically the same but they differ in the use of
BIOS or UEFI.
